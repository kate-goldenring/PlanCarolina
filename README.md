I came to college excited for the endless opportunities and soon became stifled by them. About once a week, I would redesign my four years at Carolina with a different major-minor combination in mind; however, the redesigning process would take a long time because UNC has no user-interface for visualizing all the required classes of a major. I kept making grids in Microsoft Word, until I finally declared Computer Science as my major – fourth time’s a charm. Right after I finished our secondary java course, I went home over winter break and made a java scheduling app. However, I found that executable jars are not great for sharing an app, so I came into this hack-a-thon with the goal of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in 24 hours in order to help other students visualize their 4 years.

You can select multiple UNC majors, add individual classes, or upload a unique course list as a text file -- which makes the app usable for students at other universities. Once uploaded, you can drag classes to other semesters or delete them all together. It’s also mobile friendly!
