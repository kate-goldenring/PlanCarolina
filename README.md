I came to college excited for the endless opportunities and soon became stifled by them. About once a week, I would redesign my four years at Carolina with a different major-minor combination in mind; however, the redesigning process would take a long time because UNC has no user-interface for visualizing all the required classes of a major. I kept making grids in Microsoft Word, until I finally declared Computer Science as my major – fourth time’s a charm. Right after I finished our secondary java course, I went home over winter break and made a java scheduling app. However, I found that executable jars are not great for sharing an app, so I went into Pearl Hacks with the goal of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in 24 hours in order to help other students visualize their 4 years.

You can select multiple pre-loaded UNC majors or add individual classes. Once uploaded, you can drag classes to other semesters or delete them all together. 

Since Pearl Hacks, I have continued to work on Plan Carolina.

Capabilities to login and save you schedule are coming soon.
